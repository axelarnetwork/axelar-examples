# Axelar cross-chain dapp examples

## Introduction

This repo provides the code for several example dapps in the [Axelar Local Development Environment](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev). It contains both the JavaScript and the smart contract code (.sol files) for each example. To try them out:

- Set up your system.
- Deploy and test the apps.

Note: You may see example folders in this repo that are not described below. They are either placeholders for future apps, such as the `temp` folder, or they are dapps in progress and we'll add a description when they're finished.

## Prerequisites

1. You'll need to have node.js installed to run network dapps. To make sure you have it installed, run `node -v`. If no version is returned, see [Nodejs.org/downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-gmp-examples.git` and `cd axelar-local-gmp-examples`.

3. Build contracts and tests (The update and install takes a few minutes.):
   ```
   npm update && npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. To connect to the axelar network, run `npm install axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev`.

4. To run a local node, open `axelar-local-gmp-examples` in a separate terminal and run `node scripts/createLocal`. Youâ€™ll need to have this node running to deploy the dapps.

5. To make sure that the address we use for examples is funded on all five supported testnets, run `node scripts/checkBalances`. We use `0xBa86A5719722B02a5D5e388999C25f3333c7A9fb` to deploy and test all examples. Alternatively, you can use `--address [<address>]` to specify a different address.

## Deploy and test each example

For each example, you can allow the defaults to run or enter:

- `local` or `testnet` for both the test and the deploy steps, except for deposit-address and send-token, which run on testnet.

- `source-chain` and `destination-chain`

The five supported networks are Moonbeam, Avalanche, Fantom, Ethereum, and Polygon.

- variables such as `message`, `amount`, and `account`

and run the local deploy and test.

### Call contract

This dapp relays a message from source-chain to destination-chain.

1. To deploy the dapp, run:

`node scripts/deploy examples/call-contract [<local|testnet>]`

2. To test it, run:

`node scripts/test examples/call-contract [<local|testnet>] [<source-chain] [<destination-chain>] [<message]`

For example:
`node scripts/test examples/call-contract local Moonbeam Avalanche 'Hello'`

3. To share your code cross-chain, run `yarn call-contract`.

### Call contract with token

This dapp sends aUSDC from source-chain to destination-chain and distributes it equally among all accounts specified.

1. To deploy the dapp, run:

`node scripts/deploy examples/call-contract-with-token [<local|testnet>]`

2. To test it, run:

`node scripts/test examples/call-contract-with-token [<local|testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>] [<amount>] [<account>] [<account2>]...`

### Cross chain token

This dapp mints some token at source-chain and has it sent to destination-chain.

1. To deploy the dapp, run:

`node scripts/deploy examples/cross-chain-token [<local|testnet>]`

2. To test it, run:

`node scripts/test examples/cross-chain-token [<local|testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>] [<amount>]`

### Deposit address

This dapp sends aUSDC from source-chain to destination-chain. Run it on testnet. To test it:

1. Fund `0xBa86A5719722B02a5D5e388999C25f3333c7A9fb` with aUSDC.

2. Run:

`node scripts/test examples/deposit-address [<testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>] [<amount>]`

Deposit-address is a simple send transaction. There is no smart contract to deploy.

### Headers

This dapp informs destination-chain of the last header of source-chain.

1. To deploy the dapp, run:

`node scripts/deploy examples/headers [<local|testnet>]`

2. To test it, run:

`node scripts/test examples/headers [<local|testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>]`

### NFT linker

This dapp sends the NFT that was originally minted at source-chain to destination-chain.

1. To deploy the dapp, run:

`node scripts/deploy examples/nft-linker [<local|testnet>]`

A single NFT is minted to the deployer (`0xBa86A5719722B02a5D5e388999C25f3333c7A9fb`) on each chain.

2. To test it, run:

`node scripts/test examples/nft-linker [<local|testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>]`

You cannot send a duplicate NFT to a chain. The dapp fails when the NFT is already at the destination-chain.

### Nonced execution

This dapp sends a message from source-chain to destination-chain.

1. To deploy the dapp, run:

`node scripts/deploy examples/nonced-execution [<local|testnet>]`

2. To test it, run:

`node scripts/test examples/nonced-execution [<local|testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>] [<message>]`

### Send ack

This dapp sends a message from source-chain to destination-chain.

1. To deploy the dapp, run:

`node scripts/deploy examples/send-ack [<local|testnet>]`

2. To tst it, run:

`node scripts/test examples/send-ack [<local|testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>] [<message>]`

### Send token

This dapp sends aUSDC from the source to the destination. Run it on testnet. To test it:

1. Fund `0xBa86A5719722B02a5D5e388999C25f3333c7A9fb` with aUSDC.

2. Run:

`node scripts/test examples/send-token [<testnet>] [<source-chain>] [<destination-chain>] [<amount>]`

Send-token is a simple send transaction. There is no smart contract to deploy.

## Conclusion

With each example that you try, look for confirmation in the terminal output.
