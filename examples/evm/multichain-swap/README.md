# Multichain Swap Example

This example demonstrates how to interact with the Uniswap router to do a cross chain swap. The contract can send a gmp message and a token from one blockchain to another blockchain and that message will tell the uniswap router to swap the token that was sent for another token.

# Testnet
On testnet this can be tested from Celo chain where you can send WETH to the Polygon Mumbai testnet to conduct the swap on the Uniswap router.

## Local Test
Local testing with Axelar Local Dev is WIP.
