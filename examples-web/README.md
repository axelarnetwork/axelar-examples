The `examples-web` section has a collection of end-to-end examples that include:

-   basic smart contracts invoking cross-chain calls
-   a simple webapp that invokes methods on the source chain smart contract

Each example is standalone with their own instructions to deploy and run the application, both locally and in testnet.
